A list of shortcuts to get started with Android Studio.    

1. **CTRL + Space Bar** - Useful for autocompletion.  

2. **CTRL + ALT + B** - When the cursor is on class or interface, tells who is implementing / inheriting the class / interface.  

3. **CTRL + Click** - Takes the cursor to the declaration of the thing that is clicked.  

4. **CTRL + F12** - Lists the methods defined in the class.  

5. **CTRL + N** - Opens the class / interface according to the name entered in dialog box. One can write only the subparts of the name in there.  

6. **CTRL + SHIFT + N** - Opens a *resource*. The resource could be a .xml file or property file or generated code.

7. **SHIFT + SHIFT** - The *Search Everywhere* option. It literally searches everywhere :D  

8. **CTRL + ALT + O** - Organize imports. This also removes the imports not used in the class and introduces the ones you need.  

9. Highlight some code block and press **CTRL + ALT + L** -  Reformats the code.  

Following are a couple of shortcuts useful while debugging the code.  

1. **CTRL + F8** - Introduce a breakpoint.  
The red dot with a down arrow indicates the debugger is connected with the app.

2. **F8** - Evaluate and continue debugging.  

3. **ALT + F8**  - Evaluate the expression.

4. **F9** - Continue  

5. **F7** - Step in  

6. **SHIFT + F8** - Step out  

Watch out for this space. I shall keep updating this list with shortcuts that will simplify use of Android Studio.
