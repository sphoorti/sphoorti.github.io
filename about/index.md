I am a Computer Engineer based out of Pune, India.
Programming fascinates me and I like trying out new tools and technologies.
I work as a Network Engineer at Airtight Networks and a typical day involves developing feature for 802.11ac driver, fixing broken code and analyzing packet traces while sipping tea.    
When I am not working, I contribute to [moVirt](https://github.com/matobet/movirt) - my [Outreachy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy) project.
The Linux Kernel has caught my interest and I am exploring the codebase by working on the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).    
I like long drives, 90's Bollywood tunes and Spicy Indian food.
