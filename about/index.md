I am a Computer Engineer based out of Pune, India.
Programming fascinates me and I like trying out newer tools and technologies.
I work as a Networking Engineer at Airtight Networks and a typical day involves developing feature on 802.11ac driver, fixing broken code and analyzing packet traces while sipping tea.    
When I am not working, I contribute to [moVirt](https://github.com/matobet/movirt) - my Outreachy project.
The Linux Kernel has caught up my interest and I am exploring the codebase by working on the Eudyptula Challenge.    
I like long drives, 90's Bollywood tunes and Spicy Indian food.    

Feel free to connect with me.
